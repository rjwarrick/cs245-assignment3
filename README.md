# cs245-assignment3

For Assignment 3, I imported the JSoup library to read the text from the top40weekly.com website. I was able to maintain the lines of the text that contain the artists' names and the songs. What I had hoped to do is take compare the input artist and loop through each of the lines and check if another artist's name shows up along with the input artist, thus forming a collaboration. Then I would use bfs to repeat this until there are no more collaborations.
